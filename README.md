# GoTennaTest
Mapbox implementation
//George Samuels II

This project is designed to read data from a server and save it to an SQL database.
I use Retro fit to an API to perform this action(GET),the data is stored on the device via an Sqlite database and then pulled into the list of places.
The list of places are shown in a recycler view with tools necessary for this component(Viewholder and adapter).
Using the Json Data I then plot them on the Map reading in 4 parameters of name, description ,latitude, and longitude.

//Display the userâ€™s location on the map.//Display the Pin data on the map.    -> 5hrs
